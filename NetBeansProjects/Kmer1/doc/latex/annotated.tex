\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classKmer}{Kmer}} \\*It represents a list of k consecutive nucleotides of a DNA or RNA sequence. Each nucleotide is represented with a character like \textquotesingle{}A\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}C\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}G\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}T\textquotesingle{}, \textquotesingle{}U\textquotesingle{} }{\pageref{classKmer}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classKmerFreq}{Kmer\+Freq}} \\*A pair formed by a \mbox{\hyperlink{classKmer}{Kmer}} object and a frequency (an int), that gives the frequency of a \mbox{\hyperlink{classKmer}{Kmer}} (times it appears) in a genoma }{\pageref{classKmerFreq}}{}
